# Re-Positioning and marketing recommendations to VRBO

## **Background and Research Objectives**
In 1995 Vacation Rentals by Owner (VRBO) was founded by couple Dave and Lynn Clouse.  Originally the website was designed as a marketing platform that allowed property owners to rent their properties to vacationers directly without necessitating a property management company or any other middleman.  At the time of its conception, VRBO was revolutionary.  Very few, if any, websites offered a platform that allowed property owners to rent their space directly to guests.  The concept was immediately successful and VRBO became a pioneer in the vacation rental by owner industry. 
After ten years of success, VRBO was purchased by its largest competitor, HomeAway, for $160 million in 2004.  At the time of the purchase VRBO had 65,000 properties listed on its site. Today, VRBO has over 2 million properties listed in over 190 countries.  HomeAway purchased several similar competitors to create a vacation rental marketplace.
HomeAway and VRBO cornered the market of owner offered vacation rentals and it was not until the establishment of Airbnb in 2008 that the industry started to change.  Airbnb offered the same concept, but they branded themselves as the new young fresh version of vacation rentals by owners.  With a wealth of public interest and successful advertising, Airbnb has surpassed VRBO and has gained the market share with over 4 million properties listed on their site in 190 countries.  
In the beginning VRBO charged hosts a flat rate of around $1200 annually to advertise their property.  If a property owner processed payments through the VRBO platform they were charged an additional percentage of their invoice.  However, the option to process through VRBO’s platform was optional.  Hosts had full access to guests’ contact information and could communicate directly one-on-one.  
Airbnb took a different route and rather than being just the marketing platform, they became the booking platform as well.  They charge the host 3% to 5% of every booking and the guest 10% to 12%.  Processing trough their platform is mandatory and the guest’s contact information is withheld from the host until after the booking is confirmed.  Airbnb’s approach limits the one-on-one interaction between host and guests and makes both dependent on their platform.
Due to Airbnb’s success, VRBO has been forced to reevaluate their position in the industry and they have made drastic changes to their operations.  In 2017 VRBO announced that they would no longer solely be using the marketing platform model, but rather would become a full service booking platform such as Airbnb’s model.  
Our goal with our research is to examine the steps taken by VRBO to reposition themselves and determine if their changes have had a positive impact.  We will analyze the data collected from our questionnaire to determine the position of VRBO and offer needed positioning and marketing recommendations to assist VRBO in gaining back their market share.


## **Analysis**
Using DecisionPro, positioning analysis was run for three brands: VRBO (the focal brand) and its two competitors, Airbnb and Hotel.com. A 2-dimensional analysis was run with 14 attributes, and 48 respondents. When there are only three brands, the software does not allow you to run the analysis with 3 dimensions. In any case, the cumulative variance chart shows that a third dimension would not be necessary as 100% of the variance is explained by dimensions 1 and 2.

The variance explained for each dimension is an indication of the importance of that dimension in terms of customer perception.  The Variance Explained chart shows that dimension 1 accounts for 82.4% of variance explained and dimension 2 accounts for 17.6%.

The 2D positioning map has two types of lines
•	Blue lines, also known as vectors, represent the perceptual data with 14 different attributes. The perceptual map shows the focal brand’s position in relation to the competitors as perceived by the customers.
•	Pink lines represent the preference data of 48 respondents. Primarily, it indicates what where customer perferences lie in the perceptual space and plays an important role for positioning/repositioning.

Dimension I which explains 82.4% of the total variance of the data, best describes the x-axis as “Overall Customer Experience” where to the right is more positive and the left is more negative. The attributes close to this axis are cancellation policy, variety of price ranges, and service fees.
Dimension II which explains 17.6% of total variance desribes the y-axis. This axis was named "Live-like-a-Local"-ness where in the upwards direction the brand has more of this quality and downwards there is less. It explains the relative positions of Airbnb and Hotels.com well as Airbnb promotes themselves are allowing you to “Live-like-a-local” and this one way they differentiate themselves from traditional hotels.
On the perceptual map, VRBO, Airbnb and Hotel.com are positioned at three very different locations on the map. In fact, VRBO is totally opposite of both Airbnb and Hotels.com. Airbnb and Hotels.com are postively perceived in terms most of the attributes except for “Live-like-a-Local”-ness. Our focal brand VRBO seems to have neither good overall customer experience nor high "Live-like-a-Local"-ness from the customer’s perspective. Therefore, we can conclude that at this point VRBO’s efforts to reposition themselves has not had the desired effect on their positioning.

The preference data (the pink lines) on the perceptual map did not show any clear customer preferences. Running the positioning analysis with only the preference data gives the Preference Shares table (above). This table gives the market share based on the brand with the highest preference score for each customer. We see that Airbnb has the largest market share and VRBO and Hotels.com almost tied. Based on the market share table, we would like to reposition VRBO somewhere close by Airbnb but also find an attribute that distinguishes VRBO from Airbnb.

## **Marketing Recommendations**

After analyzing our data and positioning map we have concluded that VRBO’s efforts to reposition themselves has not yet had a positive impact. Therefore we have determined weaknesses in VRBO’s approach and recommend the following to promote VRBO’s repositioning efforts.
Brand Awareness
Our data clearly identifies lack of brand awareness as a crippling issue for VRBO.  In order to reach travelers more directly, VRBO needs to invest in their brand awareness, specifically through social media.  This will be especially important if VRBO wishes to capture the attention of younger travelers who are very familiar with Airbnb and Hotels.com.  Even though VRBO has presence on Facebook, Instagram and Twitter, it is not comparable to Airbnb and Hotels.com. VRBO’s number of likes and followers in all top social media platforms are 5 to 300 times lower than the same metrics of Airbnb and Hotels.com. By analyzing the number of posts on Instagram and we can see that VRBO has the least number of posts (71) in comparison to Airbnb (1760) and Hotels.com (750). Same situation can be seen on Twitter, VRBO has 3,904 tweets, Airbnb has 36,200 and Hotels.com 32,300.
We also suggest partnering with travel influencers, for instance FunForLuis who has almost 2 million followers on Youtube. He talks about his travels all over the world. That might be a good partnership where he will promote VRBO by sharing his travel experiences provided by the new and fresh VRBO platform. Influencers tend to be cheaper to hire and partnerships with them look more natural then direct advertising.  Their connection to younger travelers can be vastly beneficial to VRBO’s efforts to reposition.

*Remodeling the Website*
VRBO’s website is outdated and does not exude the spirit of travel.  A new layout that is bright, colorful and gets the visitor excited to plan their trip is essential.  We suggest spotlighting different promotions, unique accommodations and local events to catch attention, awareness and increase traffic to the site. We see the website as a selling tool, so it's important to make user experience exceptional, smooth and easy. 

*Emphasis on strengths*
VRBO’s largest competitor is no doubt Airbnb which came up with the same idea, but 13 years later.  However with more exposure and big expenditures on marketing and promotions it surpassed VRBO in every aspect. VRBO has developed long term relationships and connections with hosts and travelers who have used their services for many years. So, we suggest that this experience and the image of well-established company be highlighted in marketing campaigns. This can be done by interviewing long term hosts and collecting feedback from customers who use the platform for many years. We want to spotlight the trustworthiness of VRBO while promoting their commitment to being on the cutting edge of the vacation rental industry.
 
*Cross promotions*
Now would be an excellent time for VRBO to reach out to other travel focused companies and create cross promotions.  Suggested organizations are rental car companies, airlines, and local event organizations such as theaters.  Virgin America had recently partners with Airbnb allowing Airbnb guests to get elevation points from Virgin America that are the analog of miles. 

## **Conclusion**
Overall, VRBO’s recent efforts to reposition their company and be a top competitor again in this market have not yet 
had a positive impact.  However, there are several options including increasing brand awareness, revamping the website, and offering cross promotions that can increase the overall awareness of the company and bring customers to their platform.  VRBO has a well established reputation among its customers and large parent company, HomeAway, backing them. All this represents a change for VRBO to take full advantage of their position and regain the market share of vacation rentals by owner industry.
